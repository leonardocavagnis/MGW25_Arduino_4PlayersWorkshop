# [WIP 🚧] MGW25_Arduino_4PlayersWorkshop 
Milano Games Week 2025 – 4 Players Workshop in collaboration with Arduino

This repository contains example sketches and resources to create your own custom USB joystick using the Arduino Nano R4 and Modulino modules. 
Participants can experiment with different input components to build a personalized game controller.

## 🎮 Components
The following components are used in the workshop:
- 1 x Arduino Nano R4
- 3 x Modulino Buttons
- 2 x Modulino Knobs
- 1 x Modulino Movement

Participants can use all components together or select only some of them in their projects.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repo contains several example sketches to help you get started.

Each sketch is a starting point to inspire custom joystick designs. 

You can combine inputs, adjust sensitivity, and create complex HID devices.
